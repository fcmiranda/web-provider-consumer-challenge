      This is a web provider/consumer application.
    <p>
      It's possible to simulate the generation of messages by the provider and the fetch messages by the consumer.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Genarate button: the front-end application request to server the generation of 100 messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fetch Messages button: the front-end application request to server the fetch of messages.
      </li>
    </ul>
    For this challenge it is necessary to make the following modifications:
    <div fxFlex="50">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Messages must be presented in a legible form, containing the information of priority, content and date.</li>
        <li>
          The message priorities must be displayed in red for "HIGH", yellow for "NORMAL" and green for "LOW".
        </li>
        <li>The  amount of generated messages must be parameterized. The front-end application must provide the amount of messages to be generated by the provider,
          for this, you must use the "total" field in the "MessagesComponent.html" view
          as a parameter of the message generation request.</li>
        <li>Messages should be grouped and ordered by priority. The front-end application must provide the amount of messages to be grouped,
          for this, you must use the "size" field in the "MessagesComponent.html" view
          as a parameter of the message loading request.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
